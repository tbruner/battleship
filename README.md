# Battleship

## Overview

This app is a basic implementation of the classic [Battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)) 
game with a very simple AI.

### Purpose

I am building this project as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) 
curriculum. The main goal of this project is for me to practice building an app using test driven development. 
This project uses vanilla Javascript, HTML, CSS, and webpack. The testing system I used is 
Jest.

## Usage

Once finished I'll have a live link for this project, and instructions on how to run this on your own machine if 
you so wish.
